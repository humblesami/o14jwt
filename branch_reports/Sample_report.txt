4 => branch_id b    => analytic account null                            40

Report (With account->branch->analytical_account) will be like
x                           amount 140(100+40)
    br = a                  amount 100(80+20)
        aa = a              amount 80(50+30)
        aa = b              amount 20
    br=b                    amount 40

How we will present above report when we consider analytical tags as well?
